what if score is measured on how many goals you've scored,
but there are more then 2 teams
so who you score against doesnt matter
then, you could consistantly aim for the weakest player, but netural players would end up
partily coming to their aid, but only as a means of preventing your score from increasing too much

Problem: you would have to ban own goals, which could make diliberatly scoring own goals a method of 'goal denial'

Or: give everyone (bar the defender) a point eveyr time any goal scored
This could cause temporary alliances to help defeat indivdual good players

Or:
'owner' of balls scores point
if own goal, they lose point

WASD move can be improved by using car mechanics, W = accerlate, A and D adjust direction
frees mouse up for powers, plus may give more fun mechanics
also harder ubt - car game from gamedesign where the whole screen rotated instead of the car,
gave fun sense of dynamic movement, worth a try to give sense of speed (even if just a paralax version?)
